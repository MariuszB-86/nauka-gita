                <h1>In the Air Tonight</h1>
                <h3>Phil Collins</h3>
                <p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord<br>
                    And I've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord<br>
                    Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord<br>
                    Well, if you told me you were drowning<br>
                    I would not lend a hand<br>
                    I've seen your face before my friend<br>
                    But I don't know if you know who I am<br>
                    Well, I was there and I saw what you did<br>
                    I saw it with my own two eyes<br>
                    So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been<br>
                    It's all been a pack of lies<br>
                    And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord<br>
                    Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord<br>
                    I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord<br>
                    Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord<br>
                    Well I remember, I remember don't worry<br>
                    How could I ever forget<br>
                    It's the first time, the last time we ever met<br>
                    But I know the reason why you keep this silence up<br>
                    No you don't fool me<br>
                    The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows<br>
                    It's no stranger to you and me<br>
                    I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord<br>
                    Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord<br>
                    I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord<br>
                    Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord<br>
                    I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord<br>
                    And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord<br>
                    I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord<br>
                    Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord<br>
                    I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord<br>
                    Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord<br>
